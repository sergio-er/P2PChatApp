Guide:
Run User on the amount of windows you want to communicate with (at least 2). 

Enter Name followed by local Port Number for each user.

Once all users are initialized, choose which users you want to communicate by typing in localhost:#### followed by a space for each user you want to connect to. (if you want to see how your messages are viewed, make sure to include your own port number).

After that, start messaging.
